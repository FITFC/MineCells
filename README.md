![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mim1q/ModPageAssets/main/sections/overview.png)

## Starting out

### To start your adventure with Mine Cells, find a portal structure.

The portal will activate for you automatically if you've already acquired diamonds in the world.

## Mobs

Mine Cells features **new monsters** which attempt to faithfully recreate the look and feel of the original game.

Keep in mind - most of these are **not yet available in survival mode**. You can summon all of them using creative spawn eggs.

## Blocks

Mine Cells adds many **new blocks**, some of which are craftable. Others are only obtainable in Mine Cells' dimensions.  
(With some exceptions which are, for now, only obtainable in creative mode or through commands.)

## Bosses

Mine Cells introduces one new boss - **The Conjunctivius**. You can find her lair in the Prison structure / dimension.

She drops some Emeralds, Diamonds, Gold Ingots and a lot of XP.  
Conjunctivius' drop will change to something more useful in the future. The location of her lair will also be changed.

**A**: Yes, but please include a link to this mod page and credit me as the author. Asking for permission beforehand is also appreciated!

### Q: Can I present this mod in my showcase video?
**A**: Yes! But you should ask me about it before creating the video, as there may be some interesting updates right around the corner.

### Q: Will you add X feature?
**A**: If it's in the original Dead Cells game, it will probably get added at some point, in one way or 
another. Feel free to [join my Discord](https://discord.gg/6TjQbSjbuB) and tell me which features you'd 
like to see the most!

### Q: Is this mod compatible with X mod?
**A**: If you want me to test whether a mod is compatible with Mine Cells, let me know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6TjQbSjbuB). 
I'll check it out and update this page with the results.  
I have plans to implement compatibility with Better Combat in the future.

**A**: A Forge version of this mod is not planned. Backporting to older versions of Minecraft is also not planned, for now.

![Disclaimer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mim1q/ModPageAssets/main/sections/disclaimer.png)

### Mine Cells is in not yet in a finished state.
It is playable in survival mode - and I hope it's fun to play! But do expect many features to be unbalanced,
missing or outright broken. 

### Dead Cells content and materials are the intellectual property of their respective owners.
I am not in affiliated with the developers in any way. This is just a passion project I made to connect two of my favorite games.
