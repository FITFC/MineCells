![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mim1q/ModPageAssets/main/sections/overview.png)

## Starting out

### To start your adventure with Mine Cells, find a portal structure.

![Mine Cells Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mim1q/MineCells/main/projectPageAssets/portal.jpg)

~~The portal will activate for you automatically if you've already acquired diamonds in the world.~~  
(To be implemented soon)

For now, you have to find a dungeon structure with Mine Cells mobs spawning. There, you will find a chest with an empty rune.  
You can fill it up by right clicking with it in your main hand. It will consume the cells you have collected from killing mobs.  
After fully charging the rune, use it on a portal frame to activate the portal.

## Mobs

Mine Cells features **new monsters** which attempt to faithfully recreate the look and feel of the original game.

Keep in mind - some of these are **not yet available in survival mode**. You can summon all of them using creative spawn eggs.

## Blocks

Mine Cells adds many **new blocks**, some of which are craftable. Others are only obtainable in Mine Cells' dimensions.  
(With some exceptions which are, for now, only obtainable in creative mode or through commands.)
